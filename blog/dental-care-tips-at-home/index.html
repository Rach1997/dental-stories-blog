Ask your dentist for specific mouthwash recommendations. Mouth wash should be avoided in children.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t neglect your tongue</strong>: plaque may also built up on the surface of tongue. Gently brush your tongue every time you brush your teeth or use a tongue cleaner.</li><li><strong>Drink lots of water</strong>: water is important to keep a healthy and active body. It is advised to drink 8 glasses of water daily. This can also help wash out some of the sticky and acidic foods and beverages in between brushes.</li><li><strong>Limit sugary and acidic diet intake</strong>: Instead opt for healthy diet of fruits and vegetables often.</li><li><strong>Avoid smoking</strong>: chronic smoking reduces the immune system of our body leading to increasing the healing time even in the tissues of oral cavity.</li><li><strong>Mental wellness</strong>: Priorities you own mental health over everything else. keep in connect with family and friends to go through tough times like these.
