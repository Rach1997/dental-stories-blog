So taking care of the oral hygiene is very much important by being at home.

Following tips can be followed to maintain a good oral hygiene:

5. **Don't neglect your tongue**: plaque may also built up on the surface of tongue. Gently brush your tongue every time you brush your teeth or use a tongue cleaner.
6. **Drink lots of water**: water is important to keep a healthy and active body. It is advised to drink 8 glasses of water daily. This can also help wash out some of the sticky and acidic foods and beverages in between brushes.
7. **Limit sugary and acidic diet intake**: Instead opt for healthy diet of fruits and vegetables often.
