Do you remember when you started brushing on your own?
Studies have shown that brushing should be started as soon as the baby has started feeding.

Here are some measures to maintain a good oral hygiene for the child:

• Even before they have any teeth wipe the gums with a warm, wet gauze piece every day. It will clean off the any sugary product left on gums.

• When tooth appears above the gum line i.e. around 6-9 months start using a soft baby brush with fluoride toothpaste with as small as grain size amount of toothpaste. Brush twice daily.

• Do not put the baby to bed with feeding bottle in the mouth. The sugars in the milk being the source of food for the bacteria, cause tooth decay.

• Parents and caregivers should not share eating utensils with a child or clean pacifiers by putting them in their mouth. Both of these actions can pass the adult’s cavity-causing bacteria to the child.

• The ADA recommends that children should visit the dentist within 6 months of their first tooth appearing or at 1 year of age.

• Children who are 3 to 6 years of age may use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. Parents should brush the child’s teeth for them until they can clean all of their teeth thoroughly without help. Monitor them to make sure that they spit out the toothpaste.

• Maintain a reward chart or a schedule chart if possible to encourage the child to brush the teeth properly.
