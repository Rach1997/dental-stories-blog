According to the World Health Organization (WHO) globally it is estimated that 2.3 billion people suffer from caries of permanent teeth and more than 5.3 million children suffer from caries of the primary teeth.

"No no my teeth never hurt I don't need to go to the dentist"
"I have a brown spot on teeth but its alright unless its hurting"
"Milk teeth are not important anyways they are going to fall out"
"Only sugar cause carries"
We all have heard these statements now and then but ever actually looked out for finding the truth? Letâ€™s go ahead and separate the facts from all these myths of dental caries we all have heard so far.

**MYTH**: If the teeth are not hurting it is not necessary to visit the dentist

**FACT**: everyone should visit the dental office every 6 months or after 1 year.

**Prevention of the caries is the best way to protect our teeth. Regular check up, fluoride application, scaling would help with caries prevention.**

**MYTH**: only sugar products can cause cavities

**FACT**: the bacteria in the month are responsible for dental caries.

**The bacteria in the month feed on the carbohydrates in the food resulting in the acidic conditions in the month. The acidic pH results in demineralization of the outer surface of the tooth structure (enamel) results in weakening of the tooth and cavity formation.**

**MYTH**: brown spot on tooth means I have got stains

**FACT**: brown spot on tooth means it is early stage of caries

**The brown spot on the tooth suggests early formation of dental caries. This is the time to visit your dentist because it's that early stage of caries where it may be reversible.**

**MYTH**: If you have dental decay you will need to remove the tooth.

**FACT**: dental decay does not always mean the tooth needs to be removed.

**The tooth decay can always be stopped and filled with a suitable dental cement. Root Canal Treatment has been very helpful to save the tooth if the decay is more. However, extraction of tooth may be the last stance if RCT cannot be done in certain cases.**

**MYTH**: dental caries in primary teeth (milk teeth) need not be treated as they fall off soon

**FACT**: Dental caries should be treated in primary teeth also.

**Dental caries in primary teeth if not treated my cause infection in many cases harming the successive permanent teeth also. Moreover healthy primary tooth helps the child to have a proper nutrition and develop good speech (teeth play a major role in proper pronunciation).**

**MYTH**: tooth once filled will not get decayed again.

**FACT**: A filled tooth may get decayed again.

**Multiple factors determine how long a filling last will.Dental decay is a microscopic phenomenon. The marginal adaptation of the material will mostly determine the accumulation of bacteria and decay if spread occurs after a few years.**

I hope many of your misconceptions have been solved in this post!
