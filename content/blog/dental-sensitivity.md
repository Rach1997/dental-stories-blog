**DENTIN** 

Have you ever felt a sudden pain while having cold food substances which further can't be explain as one caused by dental caries or other disease.Such a condition is said to be dental hypersensitivity.

**What is the reason for dentinal hypersensitivity?**

Our tooth structure consists of three parts outer enamel and inner dentin and the pulp. The dentin being a vital tissue has ability to respond to the stimulus provided. Thus, any physiological changes occurring to the dentin results in activation of nerve fibres causing pain.

Most common occurrence is around the exposed root structure.

According to various published literature, dental hypersensitivity is mostly seen in following patients with:

* Over enthusiastic brushing
* Tobacco or smoking habit
* High acidic food or alcoholic consumers
* People with xerostomia.(reduced ability to secrete saliva)
* Periodontally treated

**Treatment**:

Use of desensitizing agents as well as appropriate diet are major treatment options.

1. _Desensitizing_ _agents_ - The home applications include use of desensitizing toothpaste or tooth powders. Many of them are easily available over the counter.

   These toothpastes contain potassium salts like potassium chloride or potassium nitrate. Potassium helps in blocking the dentinal tubules over the time and reduces hypersensitivity.
2. _Proper_ _brushing_- Use a soft bristles toothbrush and appropriate brushing technique. To know the technique you may ask for the same to your dentist.
3. Appropriate diet- patient is advised to avoid  frequent acidic food substances. Recommendation to use alkaline food substances like milk or atleast water after the acidic diet intake.
4. _In_- _office_ _treatments_- If the above home treatment options isn't working in-office treatments are advised. Which includes application of varnishes, potassium oxalate, bioglass material or correction in occlusion if needed can be suggested. Your dentist will provide with the appropriate treatment options.
