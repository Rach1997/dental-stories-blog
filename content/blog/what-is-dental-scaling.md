**What is scaling? When is it done?**

  Generally going for a regular check ups your dentist will mostly advice you for ultrasonic scaling unless you are really aware of your dental hygiene and mostly importantly floss regularly.

The bacteria and debris accumulation in the areas of teeth where the brush bristles do not reach results in the plaque formation. This further marks the beginning of calculus and cause damage to the gums. 

Looking towards the damage to the gums can be evaluated by change in colour (pink to bright red), bleeding while brushing, changes in gingival contour (enlargement followed by recession) and in extreme cases this recession leads to mobile tooth and bone loss which may even result the teeth to fall off.

So scaling is a treatment to remove the biofilm (microbes present) and calculus present above as well as below (supragingival and subgingival region) the gum line. 

Dentists mostly prefer the ultrasonic method of scaling over the manual ones.They remove the bacteria ,plaque as well as the calculus accumulated on the teeth surface as well as between them and below the gum line.

**How does scaling feel?**

* Ultrasonic scalers are power driven scalers. There are two types of ultrasonic scaler. The magnetostrictive model operates at about 25,000 to 30,000 cycles per second, the head moving in a circular motion. The piezoelectric scaler moves at 28,000 to 36,000 cycles per second, while the tip vibrates back and forth against the tooth. So basically it is understood now that the scaling isn't much painful.


* In case the gum recession is more or during root planing the dentist will give a local anesthetia to relieve the pain. Root planing is similar to the scaling but is done for the exposed root surfaces.

Depending on the progression of the gum disease the dentist will decide the visits.

After the procedure is done, initially the patient might feel a little soreness or discomfort. The dentist will suggest a desensitizing toothpaste to relieve the same. Even after the scaling proper oral hygiene measures are important to avoid build up of plaque again. 

Dental scaling is quite a common treatment for gum disease as well as a prophylactic measure for the same. So if your dentist suggests you an appointment for scaling or deep cleaning do not hesitate for that, because the results in the end is always your beautiful smile :)
