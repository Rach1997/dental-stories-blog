How would you feel if I tell you all these chocolates you eat can help you to reduce caries development in your mouth?...YES..!
I would feel the same because who doesnâ€™t like chocolates!

Chocolate derived from cocoa plant contains theobromine (alkaloid) have been found to be anticariogenic in nature. theobromine can be found more in the dark chocolate than the milk chocolate.

Researchers have been working on various studies for the same and found that theobromine in the cocoa husk given an apatite-forming medium helps in enhancing the remineralisation of the enamel (outer structure of the tooth).

## COCOA HUSK EXTRACT IN TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHRINSES

Any toothpaste is said to be effective only if it helps eliminate caries resulting microbes in the oral cavity. Some studies have shown the toothpaste containing theobromine had been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity.

Similarly, other studies have shown that cocoa bean husk extract is highly effective in reducing mutans streptococci counts (caries causing microbes) and plaque deposition when used as a mouth rinse by children. Furthermore, the chocolate antimicrobial solution consisting of cocoa bean husk was proved to be effective toothbrush decontaminant.
It can also be incorporated in chocolates, beverages, chewing gums along with anticariogenic sugar substances.

Cocoa husk extracts being rich source of flavinoids with antioxidant property can help reduce gum diseases (Like periodontitis).

<ins>dark chocolate is one of the richest source of antioxidants</ins>

Although various studies have been going on this topic there is no solid proof against the effectiveness of fluoride as an anticariogenic substance which is a current gold standard substance in dental caries prevention. More research and investigation might surely help in prevention of dental caries by cocoa in the future.
